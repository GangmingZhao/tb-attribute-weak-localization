## News: 
We released the codebase of TB-weak-localization with attribute information on mmdetection.

## Updating: 
The medical dataset will be processed for publication. We will make it clearer as soon as possible.

## Paper Title: 
Computer-aided Tuberculosis Diagnosis with Attribute Reasoning Assistance.

## Paper Information:
This paper utilizes the attribute information to help Computer-aided Tuberculosis Diagnosis. The attribute information provides a strong medical domain knowledge for deep learning models.
